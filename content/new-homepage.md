For the first time in MANY years, we have a new homepage here at moparisthebest.com. This time, we decided to go with [OctoPress][2] which is a great [Jekyll][3] based blogging software.

We also need some help from you guys, what do you think we should feature on the homepage and blog about? We've had a few ideas floating around but nothing has been finalised yet and there's no exact criteria to be featured or what to actually feature. A good thing about OctoPress is that anyone can write a post or a blog entry by just forking [Moparisthebest's Github repository][4] add it, and put in a pull request and if Moparisthebest approves, it'll be committed and shown here! If you don't want to, or can't use github, just write another post in [this format][5] and email it to [Moparisthebest][6], though github submissions will be handled faster. I strongly suggest that if you want to take part in this, you read the [OctoPress blogging basics][7] documentation article.
